% The caption package allows us to change the formatting of figure captions.
% The commands here change to the suggested caption format: single spaced and a bold tag

% The cite package cleans up the way citations are handled.  For example, it
% changes the citation [1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11] into [1-3,6-11].  If your advisor
% wants superscript citations, use the overcite package instead of the cite package.

% The makeidx package makes your index for you.  To make an index entry,
% go to the place in the book that should be referenced and type
%  \index{key}
% An index entry labeled "key" (or whatever you type) will then
% be included and point to the correct page.

% The url package allows for the nice typesetting of URLs.  Since URLs are often
% long with no spaces, they mess up line wrapping.  The command \url{http://www.physics.byu.edu}
% allows LaTeX to break the url across lines at appropriate places: e.g. http://www.physics.byu.edu
\usepackage{url}
\urlstyle{rm}

% The hyperref package provides automatic linking and bookmarking for the table
% of contents, index, equation references, and figure references.
%
% To include a link in your pdf use \href{URL}{Text to be displayed}.  If your
% display text is the URL, you probably should use the \url{} command discussed
% above.
%
% To add a bookmark in the pdf you can use \pdfbookmark.  You can look up its usage
% in the hyperref package documentation
